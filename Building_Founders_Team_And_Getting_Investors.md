## Summary:-
  - finding the idea, 
    - IDEA: START WITH A CRISP THESIS AND DON’T RAISE TOO EARLY
    - Future founders, start with a really strong thesis on the problem you’re going to tackle. If you’re missing that first crucial ingredient, it’s best to keep your company building dreams on a low simmer while you work to figure one out.
    - If you’re building the same thing over and over again, that’s a signal that there might be a startup idea in there
  - standing out in the market,
    - STAND OUT IN THE CROWD BY DOUBLING DOWN ON BIG BETS AND DEMOING HOW YOU’RE DIFFERENT
  - experimenting with different models, 
    - the best founders go deep on a problem, understand all its nuances, and really immerse themselves in the customer’s pain point.
  - scaling sales, 
  - nailing customer success, and of course, 
  - assembling a winning team. From perspectives on curating company culture and intentionally screening early-hires to strategies for messaging a product's value and beating every bookings plan, early-stage teams will find plenty of wisdom here in this detailed accounting of how Looker got built.
    - Draw from a deeply personal problem and assemble the founding players.
  - Don’t raise seed money too early.
    - to self-sustain and delay hitting the investor circuit at first.
    - If you can’t demonstrate value, you’re asking investors to take it on faith. You’re asking them to take it on who you are, as opposed to the proof points sitting in front of them.

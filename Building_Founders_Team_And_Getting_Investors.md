## Summary:-
  - finding the idea, 
    - IDEA: START WITH A CRISP THESIS AND DON’T RAISE TOO EARLY
    - Future founders, start with a really strong thesis on the problem you’re going to tackle. If you’re missing that first crucial ingredient, it’s best to keep your company building dreams on a low simmer while you work to figure one out.
    - If you’re building the same thing over and over again, that’s a signal that there might be a startup idea in there
  - Not locking Business model
    - Conventional wisdom says you need to lock in a business model early on, but we found that wasn’t true. Not deciding can in fact turn out to be the best decision you’ll ever make.
    - "he decisions we didn’t make were often the ones that totally changed our business.” says Tabb
  - standing out in the market,
    - STAND OUT IN THE CROWD BY DOUBLING DOWN ON BIG BETS AND DEMOING HOW YOU’RE DIFFERENT
        - Don’t shy away from a crowded market, even if it’s tough to deliver a differentiated message.
    - (Demo)nstrate value.
        - We knew the only way to be successful was to show the goods. You know the saying, “All hat, no cattle”? We had to have the cattle.
  - experimenting with different models, 
    - the best founders go deep on a problem, understand all its nuances, and really immerse themselves in the customer’s pain point.
  - scaling sales, 
    - SALES AND GTM: LOCK DOWN A MODEL AND SCALE UP THE MACHINE
  - nailing customer success, and of course, 
  - assembling a winning team. From perspectives on curating company culture and intentionally screening early-hires to strategies for messaging a product's value and beating every bookings plan, early-stage teams will find plenty of wisdom here in this detailed accounting of how Looker got built.
    - Draw from a deeply personal problem and assemble the founding players.
  - Don’t raise seed money too early.
    - to self-sustain and delay hitting the investor circuit at first.
    - If you can’t demonstrate value, you’re asking investors to take it on faith. You’re asking them to take it on who you are, as opposed to the proof points sitting in front of them.
  - Monitoring Usage before asking for Money from Buyers
    - You need to work double time to demonstrate value very quickly pre-sales. If you can prove value early on, then the money will always show up in your bank account later.
  - Replace yourself to scale faster — even if you’re the CEO.

* “In the online world, you can't see what's going on physically. I've always thought building a tech-based startup is a bit like flying: There’s VFR, where the conditions are clear and you can see the runway, and there's IFR, where visibility is poor so you have to rely on your instruments,” says Tabb

* “All tech businesses are IFR. You can't see your customer. But the problem in 2011 was that most companies didn’t have instruments. So they were trying to fly, but they couldn’t see very well. And our bet was that if we could bring them tools to see, their businesses would take off. Several early Looker customers turned into unicorns. I’m obviously a bit biased here, but I think part of that is because they had a really good handle on their data. They could fly.” says Tabb

* “The benefit of crowded markets is that you know that there’s demand for products and that customers are willing to pay. The downside, of course, is you need a crisp insight to cut through, When I got their pitch email in 2012, the Looker product was still in its very early days, but it was clear that the bet was solid and different enough to go the distance.” says Trenchard.

* This was exactly the point Tabb was trying to get across. “It was — and still is — a crowded market of similar products taking different approaches. Yes, there are a bunch of products in the market that access data. They all sound the same. But there wasn't anything that did what we were trying to do,” says Trenchard.


### Here are Tabb’s thoughts on how they explored these different models:

    - Consulting: “Liftopia was an early customer that didn't have a data person on their team. 
    We treated this initial engagement as a consulting contract. When they needed something, they called.
    We were operating as a for-hire-data-team,” says Tabb. “We also did other consulting gigs where 
    we helped customers move their data from a MongoDB database into an analytical one, and while that worked, 
    it wasn't nearly as good.”

    - Stand-alone product: “With another early customer, the buyer was very familiar with the database 
    marketplace and tools, so he was a great person to just hand the software over to and let him try on 
    his own,” says Tabb. “It worked well — they’re still a customer today actually — but we saw that this 
    self-serve approach led him to miss a lot of the value that we'd captured with other customers.”

    - Combination. “Another one of our early customers was SimplyHired. We tried a consulting engagement
    with them at first because the product was so early that it wasn't baked enough to actually 
    have anyone use it. So I had to go in there and hook it up to their data and teach their engineers
    how to program in LookML by sitting next to them,” says Tabb. “Eventually they were up and running, 
    and as we added other features, they were able to use the product on their own.”
    
    
    
* This also informed the early product strategy. “We built monitoring tools into the product incredibly early on to make sure that we could tell if they were using it. I’d only try to close the deal once we saw the product starting to catch on around the organization — I’d never go ask for money until there was clear momentum of usage,” says Tabb. “The downside of this approach was that some of the trials ran a really long time. If we didn’t see that momentum, I’d go back in and be more hands-on to make sure they understood how we could answer all of their data questions.”

* “As a repeat founder, I often like to say that I’m a one-man band. I’ve played all the instruments and can do just about every startup job. But that doesn’t mean I do them all well. Keep the instrument you’re best at, and give the rest away.
